<P>The within-stratum (adjusted) odds ratio of exposure in cases relative to controls. This odds ratio also equals the odds ratio for disease in exposed subjects relative to unexposed subjects.  It approximates the within-stratum (adjusted) relative risk in case-control studies when the disease is rare in the general population.</P>
