<P>For Case-Control studies</P>
<blockquote>
	<P>Choose <I>Matched<B> </B>or<B> </B>Paired </I>if cases and controls are
	matched in such a way that exposure in cases may be correlated with exposure
	in controls.</P>
	<P>Choose <I>Independent</I> if exposure in cases and controls is uncorrelated.
	</P>
</blockquote>
<P>For Prospective Studies</P>
<blockquote>
	<P>Choose <i>Matched or Paired</i> if patients receiving the experimental or
	control treatment are matched or paired in such a way that the outcome in experimental
	subjects may be correlated with the outcome in matched controls.</P>
	<P>Choose <i>Independent</i> if the outcomes of cases and controls are
	uncorrelated.</P>
</blockquote>
<P>N.B. In a case-control study we determine past exposure in cases who have
disease and controls who do not.&nbsp; In prospective studies we determine
outcomes in experimental subjects who are exposed and control subjects who are
not.</P>

<P><B>How is the alternative hypothesis expressed?</B></P>

<P>Select one of the following to specify how the alternative hypothesis is expressed.  The choices you are given vary depending on the previous selections made.</P>

<ul>
  <li><B>Two proportions</B></li>
  <li><B>Relative risk</B> </li>
  <li><B>Failure rates</B></li>
</ul>

<P>The <B>odds ratio</B> approximates the relative risk in case-control studies when the disease is rare in the general population.</P>

<P><B>Uncorrected Chi-square or Fisher’s Exact-test?</B></P>

<ul>
  <li>Select<B> Uncorrected Chi-square test</B> if data will be analyzed with an uncorrected chi-squared test.</li>
  <li><B>Choose Fisher’s Exact-test</B> if data will be analyzed with Fisher's exact-test or with a continuity corrected chi-squared test.</li>
