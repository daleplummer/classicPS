# classicPS

This is the code for the original, Visual Basic 6 based Power and Sample Program (PS)

As far as I know, the PS program must be built on a Windows XP system.  That means that one
can't use the code in this repository to build PS on an arbitrary Windows computer.

There is a Windows XP virtual machine (built using Oracle VirtualBox) that we use on the
rare occasion that a new release of the PS Program must be built.

On the VM the PS directory tree is stored at c:\user\plummer\Projects\ps-development-verison
